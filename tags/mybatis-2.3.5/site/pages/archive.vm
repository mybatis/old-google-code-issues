      <h2 class="title">iBATIS 3.0 GA Candidate</h2>

      <p class="byline">Posted by Clinton Begin on Apr 22, 2010</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p> After well over a year of development and testing effort, iBATIS 3.0 is now ready for prime time.
          I've uploaded the new bundles for iBATIS 3 Core and Migrations. It is this release that we'll
          vote on for GA status. I'll leave the vote open for a good while (maybe a couple of weeks), just
          to give everyone a chance to try it out. As usual, only PMC votes actually count, but many PMC members
          will vote based on the community votes. So please offer your feedback. Otherwise, enjoy iBATIS 3.0!</p>

      Here we go. This is the version that I will vote for GA at some point. After a full month of Beta 9,
      there hasn't been any real bugs. Every issue logged was a borderline new feature. That said, just to be safe
      we'll run this last beta to ensure that the build is of high quality and that there are no last minute
      showstoppers. Enjoy.

    <p>
      Beta 9 is out. Barring any major issues, this will likely be the GA release.
      A few new minor features have been added. Automapping is now configurable,
      transaction isolation support has been added to both the two DataSource implementations
      and the SqlSession. Mapper interface inheritance is now supported. Finally, we've
      added a way to clear the local cache. Migrations also got an upgrade, with command shortcuts
      up/down step parameters and character sets can be specified in the environment config.
      The documentation has been updated with these changes. Check it out and help us get it to GA!

      Beta 8 is out. There were only 4 issues discovered during this beta period, but more
      importantly, they were quite minor and quite low level. Two could be classified as
      non-functional/performance related. So the kinds of issues we're finding now are
      in the "tweaks and tuning" classification. This gives me a lot of confidence that
      iBATIS 3 is nearing GA. Thanks again to all who posted not only Jira issues, but
      patches or tests to go with them! Without your help, we couldn't do it.

      We're getting close to a final release.
      Any issues being found are coming in far slower and they're being fixed faster. Perhaps a Christmas release?
      Let us know! Beta 7 is here and the issue log is empty. We even snuck in a few minor feature treats!
      Thanks to all of the dedicated community members who have submitted unit tests and patches, they help
      a great deal. We always give priority to issues submitted with tests or patches. Furthermore,
      this proves that our strategy of focusing on a cleaner, simpler, well-tested code base is enabling
      more participation from the community than ever. Well done everyone!

      Only a few minor issues were submitted over the last few weeks, and all have been addressed. It's been

      Only you can say for sure. Give it a try, and let us know!

    <p>
      The Fourth Beta of iBATIS 3 for contains a significant update, including a completely rewritten ResultSetHandler
      implementation. It also contains a few API changes, including a new RowBounds class for passing offset and limit
      together as a typed object. This also allows multiple parameters on mapper interfaces, further simplifying
      their use (cleaner than passing a Map, despite the ugly annotations). While I don't like to make such big changes
      in a Beta, sometimes it's necessary, and it's way better than being stuck with something we're not happy with for
      the next few years. Of course Beta 4 also contains about 20 bug fixes that were found by our diligent community.
      Enjoy.

    <small>Posted by Clinton Begin on Oct 12, 2009</small>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>
      Along with iBATIS 3, we're happy to introduce the iBATIS Schema Migration System (or iBATIS Migrations for short).
      This powerful tool was inspired by Rails Migrations and similar tools like dbdeploy to enable good database
      change management practices, help teams to work concurrently without stepping all over each other and avoid
      having to centralize database changes. Once you work this way, you'll find it very hard to work any other way
      again.
      Developers and DBAs will appreciate it equally.

  <div class="entry">
    <p>A month ago iBATIS turned 7 years old, and while we're celebrating a little late, today we're
      happy to announce iBATIS 3 for Java.
      iBATIS 3 is a complete rewrite from the ground up and thus represents the biggest change
      since the very first version of iBATIS released in 2002. There are a lot of modern features that
      take advantage of Java 5. iBATIS 3 includes simplified design and some
      great new tools for helping you build great database driven applications. iBATIS 3 carries forward
      all of the principles that have made iBATIS popular. There are still no required 3rd party dependencies,
      it's simpler than ever, and yet far more powerful! More information will come in the next few days to
      help you get started.

<h3>Call for Official QA/Testing Team Members</h3>

<p>(Jul 16, 2008) It seems that we have two very distinct types of teams using iBATIS:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adventurous bleeding edge types</li>
  <li>Conservative stable types</li>
</ul>
<p>It's hard to cater to both groups, so we've come up with a way that these groups can help each other. We've now
  provided access to
  a <b>Parabuild continuous build server</b>. The software and hosting is graciously provided by <b>Viewtier Systems</b>.
  This will
  allow the bleeding edge types to simply download the latest and greatest software, without waiting for a formal
  release by us.</p>

<p><b>In addition, we'd like to invite some of these teams or individuals to become a formal QA/Testing group for
  iBATIS.</b></p>

<p>This doesn't have to mean a lot of work! The best candidates are teams with excellent test suites for their
  applications and those who use a lot of the different features
  of iBATIS in different or even odd ways. We especially want to target groups who are using <b>Spring</b> or other 3rd
  party software that integrates
  or works closely with iBATIS. Alone we cannot test every single deployment, but together we can. This will allow us to
  learn about potential
  integration problems sooner and allow us to get to General Availability status faster.
</p>

<p>The continuous integration link and instructions can be found on the <a href="java.cgi">Java Downloads</a>
  page.</p>

<p><b>If you'd like to register yourself or your team as a formal tester</b>, please send an email to the mailing list.
  Or to Clinton Begin if you'd
  like to remain anonymous (you should know my email if you're on the list). Of course I recommend you keep it wide open
  and identify yourselves both for
  credit and so that you can share knowledge with other testers or teams</p>

<p>Thanks to all!</p>

<h3>iBATIS 2.3.3 BETA Released. And it will remain beta until...</h3>

<p>(Jul 16, 2008) Practically moments after promoting iBATIS 2.3.2 to GA, a number of nasty bugs were discovered,
  particularly with the Spring integration. We refactored a lot of
  "internal" (i.e. non-client) code in these latest versions, and so as an end-user, you really need to test the betas!
  So from now on, we're going to wait until we get enough confirmation
  from actual production implementations (either through test suites or staging environments) that things are working
  well. I'm thinking at least 20 responses before moving to GA. Maybe in the long run we'll
  identify dedicated testers who are willing to update to the latest beta and run a comprehensive application test suite
  against it. </p>

<h3>iBATIS 2.3.2 Promoted to General Availability</h3>

<p>(Jun 30, 2008) The latest version of iBATIS has been promoted to GA. This latest version requires Java 5. While it
  wasn't planned that way originally, we decided to take the plunge
  and start to "encourage" our users to upgrade their platforms (or at least become one more reason to do so). Sun will
  be discontinuing support for JDK 1.4 in about four months and
  most of the world has already moved to Java 5. This also allows us to include built-in support for enumerations and
  will better prepare you for iBATIS 3 when the time comes. </p>

<p><b><a href="java.cgi">Get the 2.3.2 GA from the Java downloads page now!</a></b></p>

<h3>iBATIS 2.3.2 Beta and German Docs</h3>

<p>(Apr 22, 2008) I've released a small update which corrects a few logistical issues with the 2.3.1 deploy. It's a very
  minor release, but this will be the next GA version if all goes well. Thus 2.3.1 will never be GA, so get this one. In
  addition to that, <b>Axel Leucht</b> has contributed documentation in German. So now all of my co-workers at Arvato
  can read about iBATIS too! ;-) Thanks Axel.

<h3>Abator Renamed to iBATOR</h3>

<p>(April 14, 2008) Due to a trade registration dispute, Abator is renamed to iBATOR. iBATOR is
  currently a work in progress, but an initial code drop has been added to SVN. See the
  <a href="ibator.html">new iBATOR page</a> for more information.
</p>

<h3>iBATIS 2.3.1 Beta Available</h3>

<p>(March 25, 2008) This is a long overdue maintenance release. Fixes about 20 issues and includes two significant
  improvements. The first is the elimination of the Throttle. Originally included to artificially constrain threads,
  requests, and transactions to improve performance on certain infrastructure. It's not as much of an issue anymore and
  today the Throttle caused more problems than it solved. So bye-bye. :-) The only real impact you'll see is that the
  maxSessions/maxTransactions/maxRequests no longer have any effect whatsoever. The other new change is built-in support
  for enums out of the box! It's currently a Beta release as per our process. But if all goes well over the next week or
  two, we'll vote to promote it to GA. The best thing you can do is test it out for us!

<h3>Abator 1.1 Available</h3>

<p>(March 20, 2008) Abator version 1.1 is available. This version has quite a few minor enhancements,
  two major enhancements (two new methods can be generated), and a few bug fixes. Check it out
  <a href="abator.html">here</a>.

<h3>It's quiet, too quiet!</h3>

<p>(March 10, 2008) Yes, we're alive. I felt the need to update the homepage since it's been a while(!). All of the
  activity is on the mailing list these days,
  and we haven't had a major release in a while. That's all about to change. The iBATIS 3.0 whiteboard has been up for a
  while and I think the ideas are sound. We've had a lot
  of great feedback and it's time to get to work. iBATIS will have it's sixth birthday on July 1st, 2008. I'd like to
  suggest that we have a Beta
  version of iBATIS 3.0 out by that day. Don't get too excited! If you're currently using 2.0, you likely will be for a
  long time (heck, Larry still uses 1.x). So, we'll
  continue to support it for a long time as well. iBATIS 3.0 will be the biggest change to the framework since the
  original concept. While we're hoping to hold
  true to some of the philosophies that have made iBATIS popular, it will look very different. Check out the iBATIS 3.0
  whiteboard for more.</p>

  3.0 Whiteboard and tell us what you think!</a></b></p>

<h3>iBATIS 3.0 Design Whiteboard</h3>

<p>(June 12, 2007) Next month, on July 1st iBATIS will officially be 5 years old, and 2.0 alone
  will be 3 years long in the tooth. It's time, or perhaps overdue that we start designing and
  implementing the third version. A lot has changed in 5 years, many best practices are now simply
  "old practices". It's time to start from scratch. Clinton's thoughts are up. This is your chance to
  influence the future direction of iBATIS.</p>

<h3>Java Documentation in 7 languages including Japanese</h3>

<p>(June 12, 2007) Thanks to the contributions from our iBATIS community, we now have
  documentation in 7 languages! The most recent addition is Japanese, which joins Chinese,
  Korean, Italian, Spanish, French and English.</p>

<p>(February 11, 2007) The votes are in an iBATIS for Java 2.3.0 is promoted to
  Apache general availability status. This release includes several bug fixes
  and enhancements.
  Additionally, this release offers new support for local caching of prepared statements.
  Caching prepared statements can lead to significant performance improvements

<p>The Java DAO framework has been removed from iBATIS as of release

<p>The paginated list methods have been deprecated with this release. The methods were confusing

<h3>iBATIS in Action Released</h3>

<p>(January 26, 2007) A book for iBATIS? No way! Yes way. The book is here.
  This is the first edition, targeting primarily the Java platform. But it's
  definitely useful for .NET and even Ruby users, even if only to understand
  the concepts and and ideas behind iBATIS. Everything else is just syntax. Some people
  may wonder if we're just trying to make money by selling documentation (sounds
  familiar to some no doubt). But trust us, writing technical books is NO way
  to make money! We did this for you, so you'd have a definitive guide to read
  from instead of wading through various internet resources. I think we're more
  worried about the Amazon.com comments than the sales... ;-) I (Clinton) really
  want to say what a fantastic experience it was to work with Brandon and Larry
  on this project. You guys did a fantastic job.</p>

<p>
  You can get the print book or the PDF edition from Manning directly (the print
  version is more expensive than Amazon, but you get the PDF version, too):<br/>

<h3>DAO Deprecated and Made Available Separately</h3>

<p>(January 26, 2007) This is a little late notice, but iBATIS for Java 2.3 has enough
  votes to go GA now, so I figured it would be good to note here. The DAO
  framework has indeed been deprecated. Deprecated doesn't mean dead. Many people
  can and will continue to use it. In fact, it will be a bit cleaner because
  it's made available separately so you can feel more comfortable changing it if you
  need to. Feel free to take the code and make it your own. Or just use it as
  is until it gets too old (it's pretty easy to switch iBATIS DAOs to Spring DAOs
  if and when the time is right). We've made the Java DAO framework permanently available
  on the Java downloads page. Deprecated basically means we just won't be
  adding any features to it in the future, which is pretty much the same way it's been
  for a couple of years -- I guess it's perfect. ;-) Kidding.</p>

<p><b><a href="java.cgi">The DAO framework will always be available here.</a></b></p>


<h3>iBATIS for Java 2.2.0 General Availability</h3>

<p>(December 5, 2006) The votes are in and iBATIS for Java 2.2.0 is promoted
  to general availabilty status. This release is the most significant release
  of iBATIS in at least a year. See the
  release notes on the download page for full details.
  This is the last release of iBATIS that will include the DAO framework.</p>

<h3>RBatis - iBATIS for Ruby has been released!</h3>

<p>(Jul 30, 2006) As promised almost exactly one year ago...iBATIS for Ruby is now here. Jon Tirsen
  has joined the team and RBatis is ready to roll with a plug-in for Rails of course. You can see
  the permanent link in the Path to iBATIS on the left, but don't waste time moving your mouse....</p>

<p><a href="docs/ruby">Check it out!</a></p>

<h3>DTDs @ iBATIS.com - The Deed has been done</h3>

<p>(Jul 30, 2006) The DTDs hosted at iBATIS.com have been permanently removed. The multiple warnings
  went starting with a broadcast announcement to the mailing lists and a permanent space on the homepage.
  With over 1.5 million hits to the DTD per month, it was time to move the burden over to the Apache servers. ;-)
  If you're a year behind on your email and using an old version of iBATIS, and you're wondering why
  your application won't start anymore...try changing the DOCTYPE of your XML files to the following.</p>

  <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE sqlMapConfig <br/>
            PUBLIC "-//ibatis.apache.org//DTD SQL Map Config 2.0//EN" <br/>

<h3>iBATIS for Java 2.3.0 Released [Status: Beta]</h3>

<p>(December 1, 2006) This release includes several bug fixes and enhancements.
  Additionally, this release offers new support for local caching of prepared statements.
  Caching prepared statements can lead to significant performance improvements
  in many environments.</p>

<p>The Java DAO framework has been removed from iBATIS as of release
  2.3.0. We heartily recommend that you consider using the
  <a href="http://www.springframework.org" target="_blank">Spring Framework</a>
  for all your DAO needs! Spring offers great support for iBATIS.</p>

<p>The paginated list methods have been deprecated with this release. The methods were confusing
  to many users and often misused. We suggest using native database support for paging,
  or that you use the query methods with skip and max settings.</p>

<p><b><a href="java.cgi">Download iBATIS 2.3.0!</a></b></p>

<h3>iBATIS for Java 2.2.0 Released [Status: Beta]</h3>

<p>(August 16, 2006) This is probably the most significant iBATIS 2.x release in at least a year. If you
  haven't upgraded in a while, this would be the one to go for. This update includes 25 new minor features
  15 bug fixes and 3 new major features including support for Oracle cursors, multiple result sets and
  private bean properties. This is also the first release that requires JDK 1.4 (as voted nearly a year ago).
</p>

<h3>Fall is a great time for a conference!</h3>

<p>(Jul 30, 2006) We've just added a new event to the calendar. <b>Calgary in September:</b> Clinton will be
  presenting on all things iBATIS, Ajax, Agile and ...erm, Ruby. Not that he's a buzzword chaser or
  anything. </p>

<h3>iBATIS Java 2.1.7 - Maintenance Release - Last 1.3 Compatible Release!</h3>

<p>(Jan 21, 2006) Well, as we said back in November, iBATIS will require JDK 1.4 as of the 2.2.0 release.
  We expect that this 2.1.7 release will be the last JDK 1.3 compatible release that we make, unless a serious
  stability or security flaw is found, in which case we'll deploy a fix from a branch of the source. This release
  contains a number of minor bug fixes, an enhanced entity resolver. 2.2.0 will be an interesting release with
  some new features that we've been looking forward to.

<h3>New Tools Section</h3>

<h3>Have a look at JPetStore 5.0</h3>

<p>(Dec 8, 2005) JPetStore 5.0 is now available. This release focuses on cleaning up some of the mess created by
  JPetStore's heritage as a testbed for performance and comparisons to other implementations including LOC benchmarks,
  which are a horrible thing. Significant changes and additions include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>One step deploy!</b> JPetStore is now easier to deploy, and assuming you already have Tomcat and a JDK
    installed, it's literally one step. Drop the WAR file into Tomcat's webapps folder, and you're good to go.
    JPetStore now includes HSQLDB and, with the default configuration, will deploy an in-memory database for
    the duration of your run. Of course, all of the other databases such as Oracle and MS SQL Server are
    still supported as well.
  </li>
  <li><b>93% Unit test coverage.</b> It's about time, as it was quite embarassing not having adequate unit
    tests for JPetStore for all of this time. All layers are covered fairly well, including the actions
    services and data access objects.
  </li>
  <li><b>XHTML/CSS web pages.</b> No more 1990's style web development practices. JPetStore now features web pages
    based on XHTML and CSS. That said, I (Clinton) am not much of an artist, so it still is no marvel of
    visual style. However, I think it does look quite a bit better.
  </li>
  <li><b>Upgraded dependencies.</b> All of the 3rd party dependencies have been upgraded to their latest versions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>As of 2.2.0 -- JDK 1.4 Required, iBATIS 1.x Compat Libs Removed, DTDs moved to Apache, </h3>

<p>(Nov 8, 2005) All software systems that last any length of time tend to suffer from compatibility
  baggage. iBATIS is no different. iBATIS has remaind 99% backward compatible for 3.5 years now.
  Unfortunately the baggage necessary to continue that way is impeding our ability to move the framework
  forward. So it's time to pay the piper and upgrade. Here's the plan:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>JDK 1.4 will be required as of version 2.2.0.</b> We will continue to support
    the 2.1.6 codebase for critical releases only. No major features will be added to 2.1.6. Version
    2.2.0 will be the next version released, leaving us some room for official maintenance releases
    for the 2.1.6 branch if necessary. We estimate that about 13% of our users are still using JDK 1.3.
  </li>
  <li><b>iBATIS 1.x Compatibility libraries will be removed as of version 2.2.0.</b> Since iBATIS version 2.0 was
    released, it has included a backward compatibility library that allowed iBATIS 1.x applications to run on the
    2.0 framework. We estimate that 3% of iBATIS users are using iBATIS 1.x, which is not enough to continue
    supporting the compatibility library. Of course it will still be available from Subversion.
  </li>
  <li><b>All DTDs will be moved to ibatis.apache.org as of December 30th, 2005.</b> These DTDs will no longer be
    available from iBATIS.com. Instead you must change your doctype declarations to point to the new location at
    ibatis.apache.org. The new doctypes are as follows:
  </li>
</ul>
<pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE sqlMapConfig
      PUBLIC "-//ibatis.apache.org//DTD SQL Map Config 2.0//EN"
      "http://ibatis.apache.org/dtd/sql-map-config-2.dtd"&gt;
</pre>
<pre>
  &lt;!DOCTYPE sqlMap

<h3>iBATIS Java 2.1.6 - Maintenance Release</h3>

<p>(Nov 5, 2005) Just released a maintenance release to take care of the summer bug list. This puts us
  in a good spot to start planning for 2.2.0, where we're currently discussing some changes to the current
  version support levels, which will enable us to add a bunch of new features. If you aren't on the dev or
  Java mailing list, then join up to discuss! For now, enjoy the cleanliness of version 2.1.6.

<h3>iBATIS for Ruby</h3>

<p>(August 25, 2005) It's official. iBATIS is no longer a simple tool or framework. It is a genuine
  approach to integrating object oriented applications and relational databases. We could have said that
  when the .NET version was released, but now we MUST say it. We're very excited to be merging with a
  project headed up by Jon Tirsen, a friend of mine and a fellow ThoughtWorker. He's ported and innovated
  iBATIS for the Ruby language, which we're all very excited about. In the next few weeks we'll be
  integrating iBATIS for Ruby into our infrastructure, and of course, Jon will become one of our valuable
  team members.</p>

<h3>Developers, Developers, Developers...</h3>

<p>(August 24, 2005) What a crazy month. Everyone has been so busy over the summer! But despite
  our schedules, we've made some amazing progress. First and foremost, let's introduce our new
  committers. The following people have been voted in as committers and are currently in the process
  of getting access to the iBATIS resources.

<h3>iBATIS for Java 2.1.5 Released</h3>

<p>(July 17, 2005) We've released a maintenance release, with a few bonuses as well. The most
  notable changes are: 1) iBATIS no longer depends on commons logging, and 2) the entity resolvers
  are now smarter so that they should resolve DTDs without the network as long as you have
  a correct XML DOCTYPE header. In addition to that, we've fixed a bunch of bugs including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed IBATIS-136 groupBy not carried forward to extended result maps</li>
  <li>Fixed IBATIS-139 discriminator being applied to too many result maps (thanks Sven)</li>
  <li>Fixed IBATIS-152, 149, 116 null result sets now handled properly by JDBC logging classes (thanks Sven)</li>
  <li>Fixed IBATIS-146 consumes additional result sets before retrieving output params (JTDS fix)</li>
  <li>Fixed IBATIS-130 parameter maps don't allow for complete TypeHandler implementations</li>
  <li>Fixed IBATIS-148 fixed dynamic SQL in iterates</li>
</ul>

<h3>May 16: iBATIS for Java 2.1.0 Released!</h3>

<p>This release includes some cool new features like &lt;discriminator&gt;
  and &lt;subMap&gt; tags for better support of class inheritance. There's
  an example of how to use these new tags <a

<h3>May 9: New Website</h3>

<p>Welcome to our new website. It's now more focused on the Apache iBATIS
  tools like Data Mapper and Data Access Objects, and the example Pet Store
  applications. If there's something missing that you found useful before,
  please let us know (see issue tracker to the left). The new site is free
  of tool dependencies and is based on Staticmesh from <a
      href="http://www.pols.co.uk/downloads/static-mesh/">Pols Consulting</a>.
  The idea is to maintain a single site, but we'll likely deploy it to both
  the apache.org site and ibatis.com, or perhaps we'll just forward
  ibatis.com to apache.org. Either way, we'll have one site that is
  maintainable by the whole team. Enjoy.</p>


<h3>May 1: Successfully Incubated</h3>

<p>We've been successfully incubated and are ready to become an official
  Apache project. Our incubation checklist is complete, and now we
  have some new checklist items to get started on. Basically it involves
  moving the apache <strong>website </strong>and the <strong>mailing
    lists</strong>. This will be done with minimal impact to our community.
  Hopefully it will all be done within the next few weeks.</p>

<h3>Apache Incubator Status - Complete!</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong><font color="#006600">DONE &gt;&gt;</font>
    Move Discussions to Apache Mailing Lists:</strong> The old
    SourceForge forums are now closed. We all use the Apache
    Mailing Lists now for support and development discussions.
    So far, I think we're happy with the results. See the support
    page for resource info.
  </li>
  <li><strong><font color="#006600">DONE &gt;&gt;</font>
    Move Bug tracking to JIRA:</strong> The SourceForge bug
    tracker has been closed. We've moved to JIRA and so far
    the results are good. JIRA is a bit slower, but arguably
    does a much better job of organizing and tracking bugs and
    their lifecycle.
  </li>
  <li><strong><font color="#006600">DONE &gt;&gt;</font>
    Apache Wiki:</strong> We've set up a Wiki to help us keep
    up with the fast pace of iBATIS, including new features
    and issues that would normally take months to get into the
    documentation. If you can't find it in the documentation,
    you'll hopefully find it on the Wiki <em>(FAQs, undocumented
      items, environment specific solutions and 3rd party contributions
      and tools)</em>.

  I'll be doing a maintenance release (2.0.9b) within a day or two in order
  to keep you all up and running. As planned, 2.1 will be a feature release
  with some cool stuff. You can also browse our repository or even checkout

<p class="general"><strong class="general">Jan
  1 , 2005 @ 1:05am -- iBATIS 2.0.9 Now Available -- Happy New Year!<br>
</strong>Well, it's been a long time since we've released any major features.
  We've been working on stabilizing the platform, organizing the team and
  supporting the community. We like to consider this progress, but sometimes
  we want is features. So here we go! Check out the new feature list:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="general"><strong>Solution for N+1 selects for 1:M and M:N.</strong>
    Version 2.0 was always designed for this, I just didn't have a chance
    to implement it, until now. It's made possible by two small additions
    to the mappings
    <ul>
      <li>&lt;resultMap...groupBy=&quot;prop1,prop2&quot;&gt; </li>

      <li>&lt;result...resultMap=&quot;subResultMapForCollectionItems&quot;&gt;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="general"><strong>Remappable result sets!</strong> So, you're
    one of those people who wants to use a dynamic SELECT clause in your
    SQL Maps? Now you can. One simple addition to your select statements.
    <ul>
      <li>&lt;select...remapResults=&quot;true&quot;&gt;</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="general"><strong>Isolation Level Support. </strong>Now you
    can specify the transaction isolation level when starting a transaction.
    Simply specify it as a parameter of SqlMapClient.startTransaction (int
    isolationLevel).
  </li>
  <li class="general"><strong>SQL Fragment Includes.</strong> No more repeated
    where clauses. If you have a need to repeat (such as a count * and a
    column list version of a query), now you can include the common part
    of the statement. Simply declare an &lt;sql&gt; element with an id,
    then &lt;include&gt; it with a refid. You can also use dynamic SQL,
    inline parameters and anything else you can put in any other statement.
    Two new elements:
    <ul>

      <li>&lt;sql id=&quot;someSqlToInclude&quot;&gt; ... WHERE BLAH = BLAH
        ...&lt;/sql&gt;</li>
      <li>&lt;include refid=&quot;someSqlToInclude&quot;/&gt;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li class="general"><strong>Default CLOB/BLOB Handlers.</strong> Why punish
    everyone with a good database driver? We've now included default LOB
    handlers for byte[] and large strings. Any mapping to byte[] with BLOB
    or LONGVARGBINARY will use the BLOB handler; and any mapping to String
    with CLOB or LONGVARCHAR will use CLOB. Only poor database drivers are
    not supported, and may still require a custom tag handler. In those
    cases, you can use the default ones as an example (they're implemented
    as CTH).
  </li>

  <li class="general"><strong>Other features include: </strong>TopLink DAO
    template and TX manager, support for directly implementing TagHandler
    interface (in place of CTH), a completely refactored XML parser and
    a few minor bug fixes.
  </li>
  <li class="general"><strong>Documentation coming soon.</strong> &quot;Yeah
    right!&quot;, you say! Well, admittedly we have been slow to document
    lately. Now we have a solution for keeping up with ourselves. Our<strong>
      Wiki </strong>will serve as a documentation launch pad where everyone
    (including us) can contribute to the documentation of the new features.
    Good documentation will be promoted to the developer guide.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nov 26, 2004: iBATIS version 2.0.8 Released</strong><br>

  Under the new release plan, we'll be alternating between bug fix releases
  and feature releases. Version 2.0.8 is a bug fix release, and therefore
  the next release will be a feature release. This approach will keep the
  product stable while offering power users access to new features earlier
  and on a more consistent release schedule.<br>

<p class="general"><strong class="general">Oct 31, 2004: Happy Halloween
  from iBATIS and The Apache Software Foundation<br>
</strong>iBATIS has been voted into the Apache Incubator, and a number
  of resources have been set up. Over the next few weeks, we'll be switching
  over our current SourceForge resources over to Apache. To begin with,
  this will include: </p>

<ol>
  <li class="general"><strong>SourceForge Forums</strong> and mailing list
    wil be ramped down. We may finish up with a few existing discussions
    there, but at some point new posts will cease to be accepted. I'm sure
    this comes as welcome news, as the SourceForge forums aren't that great.
  </li>
  <li class="general"><strong>SourceForge CVS </strong>will be switched
    to Apache's Subversion repository. This is another great bonus, as SourceForge
    does not support SVN.
  </li>
  <li class="general"><strong>SourceForge Bug Tracker</strong> will be moved
    to Apache Jira. Need we even explain how huge of an improvement this
    will be? Jira rocks.
  </li>
  <li class="general"><strong>iBATIS.com </strong>will be around for a long
    time. All of the key resources will be migrated to Apache, but I'll
    maintain this as a gateway to those resources for as long as the community
    finds it useful and not redundant.
  </li>

</ol>
<p><strong class="general">Oct 4, 2004: iBATIS .NET 1.0.0 Released!&nbsp;
  - The first and only cross platform, open source persistence solution.</strong></p>

<p>Well, there's really only one news story worthy of the front page today,
  which is the release of iBATIS .NET 1.0.0.&nbsp; This is an absolutely
  amazing achievement which brings the unique iBATIS solution to the world
  of .NET. Special thanks to <b>Gilles Bayon</b> and <b>Ted Husted</b> for
  making this possible.&nbsp; Now C# programmers can benefit from the flexibility
  of SQL <i>and</i> the practicality of a time saving Data Mapper API.&nbsp;
  In addition, Java developers can know that the skills they learn with
  iBATIS are transferable to another platform.&nbsp; iBATIS truly is the
  best of both worlds, and is now available in both worlds as well!&nbsp;
  What would an iBATIS product be without the sale of pets online?&nbsp;
  The<b> NPetShop 1.0</b> demo application is also available.&nbsp; There
  is also a <b>developer guide</b> to help familiarize you with the iBATIS
  way. <br>

<p><strong class="general">Sept 12, 2004: Busy Summer - Update<br>

</strong>The iBATIS team has had a busy summer. Mixed in with vacations,
  application to Apache, design discussions, day-to-day support, bug fixes...oh,
  and real jobs, we've been keeping rather busy. I'm currently working on
  a project in Palo Alto. I figured my evenings would be free to code iBATIS,
  but we've been taking upwards of 3 hours to have dinner, so.... Anyway,
  iBATIS has been voted into the Apache incubator and are currently awaiting
  some resources (mailing lists, svn, jira, web etc.). In addition to that,
  we're hoping to get to work on the current bug list and get a release
  out. Updating the documentation is also at the top of our list. Watch
  for these in the coming days, weeks and months.</p>

<p><strong class="general">August 11, 2004: iBATIS 2.0.5 Featuring Custom
  Type Handlers!<br>
</strong>The first major feature since the 2.0 release is here. The new
  Custom Type Handlers will allow you to deal with odd data, unsupported
  JDBC types and translate or transform values. The implementation is simple,
  and I'll try to get an example up on the site soon. This release also
  features a number of DAO enhancements and bug fixes. See the <a href="common/changelog.html">

  Are you working with .Net and miss iBATIS? Well, that can stop right now.
  Gilles Bayon has a very good start on a .Net equivalent SQL Mapping framework
  called Nausicaa. In the months to come the iBATIS team will be supporting
  Nausicaa any way we can. <br>

  3 </strong><br>
  This release completes the &quot;to-do&quot; list for final release. It
  adds a couple of small configuration features and a few minor bug fixes.
  Final release is expected shortly. I've also updated the site examples
  to 2.0. <br>

<p class="general"><strong>Apr 11, 2004: SQL Maps and DAO 2.0 Release Candidate
  2 </strong><br>
  This weekend I finished unpacking my house, except for my books. I can't
  unpack those until I replace the yucky flowery heart border in my new
  office. Anyway, iBATIS Database Layer components including SQL Maps 2.0
  and Data Access Objects 2.0 have been released as Release Candidate 2.
  For all of those waiting, I have in fact exposed the <strong>flushDataCache()
  </strong>method for manually flushing the cache. I've also worked through
  the entire list of bugs and squashed (or denied) every one of them. ;-)

<p class="general"><strong>Apr 7, 2004: Back on Track!</strong><br>
  Well I returned back from NYC to my new house, which is still not completely
  unpacked. After getting my other affairs in order, I had a look at my
  SourceForge forums and email and realized how far behind I was. To top
  it off, I had some difficulties with email that caused some of it to be
  lost. DOH! Now that things are settling down, I'm looking to get some
  long overdue work done on iBATIS. Look forward to it later this weekend.</p>

<p class="general"><strong>Apr 5, 2004: Back from NYC </strong><br>
  Wow, what a fabulous trip! In NYC I was able to hook up with some of the
  brightest minds in open source software including Ted Husted, Matt Raible,
  Rod Johnson, Steve Raeburn, Jason Carriera --and of course we have Vic
  Cekvenich to thank for it! It was a great time and the seminar was a great
  success with lots of positive feedback. Awesome!</p>

<p class="general"><strong>Mar 31, 2004: Out of Town</strong><br>
  Well, the house is moved and I my network is up and running --all just
  in time to take a little trip! I'll be on the road for a few days (until
  Monday) and will therefore be unresponsive to email requests and forum
  posts. Please help out by answering questions on the forums and posting
  bug patches for the outstanding bugs. For now, I leave you with these
  words of wisdom:</p>

<p class="general"><em>Laptops do not drink beer. Not even in Canada. I
  hope Dell understands. :-)</em></p>

<p class="general"><strong>Mar 25, 2004: Moving to a new House</strong><br>

  I'll be a little less responsive over the next few days, as I am moving
  to a new house. This means that my development computers/servers will
  be boxed and packed. Normally it wouldn't be so long, but the wiring in
  the new house was done by a weekend-warrior, and the polarity is backwards
  on a number of the electrical outlets (including my new office). I'm no
  electrician myself, so I'll have to get out my <em>Zap the Safety Bird</em>
  manual and fix them before I can plug my electronics in. I will have my
  laptop available for checking email, but I'm sure unpacking will keep
  me busy too. </p>

  The official example for SQL Maps 2.0 and DAO 2.0 is now available. JPetStore
  4.0 has retired from the platform comparison business and is now exclusively
  an example application for iBATIS and other frameworks. In addition to
  using the iBATIS persistence layer products, it also sports a new <em>experimental</em>
  presentation layer based on Struts.<br>

<p class="general"><strong>Mar 8, 2004: SQL Maps and DAO 2.0 Beta 5 </strong><br>
  Both SQL Maps and DAO 2.0 Beta 5 are now available! This is a pretty big
  release, as it resolves all known &quot;functional bugs&quot; and includes
  a couple of non-trivial refactorings. Particularly the SqlMapClient interfaces
  have been reshuffled (no major impacts) and the getSession() method has
  been deprecated and renamed to openSession(). This release also contains
  <strong>DAO 2.0</strong>, which has now passed all concurrency and performance
  tests. <strong>Developer guides are also available for both frameworks!</strong><br>

<p class="general"><strong>Feb 18, 2004: SQL Maps Beta 3 includes Documentation</strong><br>

  SQL Maps Beta 3 is released and includes the first draft of the 2.0 Developer
  guide. Have a look at it and let me know what you think. I kept the same
  basic format. Beta 3 also has some important changes including renaming
  the <em>queryWithRowHandler()</em> method. It is now an overload of the
  <em>queryForList()</em> method, which is more clear and concise. The &lt;procedure&gt;
  <em>output=&quot;true|false&quot;</em> attribute has also been renamed
  to <em>mode=&quot;IN|OUT|INOUT&quot;</em>, so that pure OUT parameters
  are now supported. In addition to that, there are some bug fixes (of course)
  and a new build.xml. <br>

  a Happy XML Editor</strong><br>
  Only 2 days 'till Valentine's Day...have you done your shopping yet? Be
  sure to go out and get your special someone a gift. Personally I prefer
  the free ones that edit XML. If you don't have a good IDE that supports
  XML editing and validation, or if you want something that starts up in
  less than 12 minutes, try this one from BEA. It's small, simple, free
  and works well. It makes a great gift too...I'm sure my wife will love
  it. :-) Speaking of family issues, we just completed a house deal (sale
  and purchase), which is what has been occupying my free time for the last
  couple weeks. I'll be focusing on the next build of SQL Maps 2.0 Beta
  in the next week or so (after Valentine's day of course). <br>

<p class="general"><strong>Feb 1, 2004: Super Bowl and a couple or releases
</strong><br>
  What better way to spend a Sunday than watching Super Bowl, eating pizza
  and coding? Yeah, I know it's pretty sad. :-) What is even more sad is
  that it seems like Kid Rock was the only half-time performer who wasn't
  lip synching! [Or is he just good at it?] And did P. Diddy have grey hair?
  Man, even I'm getting old! Anyway, I've released 1.3.1 and 2.0 build 107.
  Both are pretty small releases that just fix a couple of minor bugs. Cheers!</p>

<p class="general"><strong>Jan 20, 2004: Long Overdue News -- Spring Framework
  1.0 M4 includes iBATIS SQL Maps support</strong><br>
  Spring is a lightweight container that provides a great deal of pluggable

  alternative to EJBs bloated app servers that can quickly empty your projects
  wallet. <a href="http://www.springframework.org">http://www.springframework.org</a></p>

<p class="general"><strong>Jan 20, 2004: iBATIS DB Layer 1.3.0 Released</strong><br>
  This is a small release that fixes a couple rare bugs and adds a few small
  features...but then again, there's nothing like having the latest version.
  :-) The major significance of the 1.3.0 release is that it celebrates
  the maturity of the 1.x line, both in terms of stability and age. The
  code base is actually 2 years old now! Although it didn't show up on SourceForge
  until September 2002, the DAO framework and the foundations of SQL Maps
  were in use at least 9 months earlier. So what better way to celebrate
  than to rewrite the whole thing from the ground up...2.0 Beta 2 is available
  (see above), so be sure to try it out. See the <a href="common/sqlmaps.html">SQL
    Maps Homepage</a> or the <a href="common/sqlmaps2.html">SQL Maps 2.0 Status
    page</a>for more.</p>

<p><strong>Jan 18, 2004: Updated: Generate JavaBeans and SqlMaps from DDL</strong><br>
  Alex Egorov has written a Perl script that uses the DDL from your database
  to generate JavaBeans and SQL Maps. It's in the early stages (<strong>0.1.8</strong>),
  but will surely end up being a really cool tool! <a href="http://alxeg.narod.ru/ibatis/index.html">http://alxeg.narod.ru/ibatis/index.html</a>

<p><strong>Jan 5, 2004: Updated JPetStore/MySQL Tutorial</strong><br>

  Adrian Lanning is at it again writing fantastic tutorials for web developers.
  The new tutorial discusses setup of JPetStore on Windows with MySQL and
  Tomcat. It also sports a pretty new HTML format for easy reading. <a

    it out!</a></p>

<p><strong>Jan 5 , 2004: iBATIS 1.2.9b</strong><br>
  The biggest change in this release is the JAR file packaging. The framework
  is now in 3 JAR files (common, sqlmap, dao). Other than that, it fixes
  a bug or two and is once again compiled with JDK 1.3 for maximum compatibility.
  <a href="common/download.html">Get it here.</a></p>

<p><strong>December 24, 2003: Merry Christmas Everyone!</strong></p>

<p><strong>December 24, 2003: Chinese Developer Guide.</strong> The iBATIS
  DB Layer Developer Guide is now available in Chinese. Big thanks to Liu
  Tao for the translation! You can get it from the download page.</p>

<p><strong>December 14, 2003: SQL Maps 2.0 Update.</strong><br>
  Slowly but surely SQL Maps 2.0 is making its way to Beta 1. I'm hoping
  to have it available before the end of December. With Christmas and wrapping
  up the end of the year, it might be January before a public Beta becomes
  available. If you'd like to try it out sooner, toss me an email and I'll
  send you a JAR to play with.</p>

<p><strong>December 14, 2003: DB Layer 1.2.9 Released.</strong> This is
  a simple bug fix release that focuses on compatibility. The framework
  is now compiled under JDK 1.4, but should still work with 1.3 without
  issue. Also, due to version conflicts, CGLIB has been removed completely.
  iBATIS DBL 2.0 will reimplemt it using the new CGLIB 2.0. For a complete
  list of changes, see the download page.</p>

<p><strong>November 8, 2003: A MySQL Tutorial for JPetStore</strong> has
  been submitted by Adrian Lanning. If you're a MySQL user or interested
  in trying it, download it here! I'll add it to the standard distribution
  in the next release. Thanks Adrian!</p>

<p><strong>October 12, 2003: iBATIS DB Layer 1.2.8! </strong>A small release
  of iBATIS DBL. Some simple bug fixes (caching, stored procs) and an improvement
  to the Paginated List API (prev/next now returns boolean for a more familiar
  paradigm). Check it out!</p>

<p><strong>October 12, 2003: JPetStore 3.1.1.</strong> Just a simple JP
  release that includes DDL for some additional databases (HSQL, MySQL...).
  No functional changes. Download it here.</p>

<p><strong>October 1, 2003: Busy, Busy, Busy!</strong> But who isn't these
  days? I've been super busy with &quot;life stuff&quot; such as changing
  employers. Very exciting, but it's a lot of work! Work to work I suppose...
  Things coming down the pipe hopefully in the coming weeks and months:
  Response to Philip Greenspun's SUV comment (late but better than never),
  some simple updates to iBATIS DBL, a small JPetStore release and most
  importantly....iBATIS DBL 2 (alpha)! Tease... So please bear with me while
  I complete my transition and we'll start seeing some new stuff soon!</p>

<p><strong>September 5 , 2003: iBATIS DB Layer 1.2.7 Now Available! </strong>This
  release introduces a completely new cache model that allows for pluggable
  caching strategies. There are 2 new built in strategies (LRU, FIFO), in
  addition to support for OSCache --a distributable caching framework! The
  new cache model is completely backward compatible. Check it out!</p>

<p><strong>August 17, 2003: iBATIS DB Layer 1.2.6 Now Available!</strong>
  This is a small release that includes some enhancements such as: extendible
  result maps, improved LOB support (driver dependant), performance improvements

  little behind. Having my wisdom teeth out last week isn't helping either
  (OW!). I hope to have my servers back up by Sunday May 11. Until then,
